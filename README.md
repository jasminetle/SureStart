Day 1: February 8, 2021

Throughout the SureStart program, I hope to gain a better understanding about machine learning and artificial intelligence. I am excited to deepen my understanding on how AI and machine learning works. Additionally, I want to gain more confidence speaking about technical topics and more experience working within a team environment. I want to improve my soft skills while continuing to develop my technical skills. I am looking forward to working with and getting to know the wonderful people in the program. I am grateful for the opporunity to learn from my team, mentor, and the sure start team!
