**Day 1: February 8, 2021**

Throughout the SureStart program, I hope to gain a better understanding about machine learning and artificial intelligence. I am excited to deepen my understanding on how AI and machine learning works. Additionally, I want to gain more confidence speaking about technical topics and more experience working within a team environment. I want to improve my soft skills while continuing to develop my technical skills. I am looking forward to working with and getting to know the wonderful people in the program. I am grateful for the opporunity to learn from my team, mentor, and the sure start team!

1. Supervised learning incorporates a data set for training the program to provide it with the ability to determine an accurate interpretation for newly introduced data. In contrast, unsupervised learning relies on the program finding patterns and relationships between a given data set; unsupervised learning makes correlations between data without the use of training examples.

2. Scikit-Learn is a machine learning library uses for data modeling, but it is not helpful in visualizing data. This is why Scikil-Learn is used with other libraries such as Graphviz, Pandas, etc. to assist in the analysis,visualisation, and manipulation of data.
