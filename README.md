Throughout the SureStart program, I hope to gain a better understanding about machine learning and artificial intelligence. I am excited to deepen my understanding on how AI and machine learning works. Additionally, I want to gain more confidence speaking about technical topics and more experience working within a team environment. I want to improve my soft skills while continuing to develop my technical skills. I am looking forward to working with and getting to know the wonderful people in the program. I am grateful for the opporunity to learn from my team, mentor, and the sure start team!

My team and I had our first team meeting today, and we were able to analyze and determine our scrums for the next three days. I became a lot more familiar with machine learning models and algorithms after reading the articles. It was facinating to read how a program goes about making determinations on new data and the math behind it all. Additionally, I learned how to use Jupyter notebook for the first time and became more familiar with the Scikit-learn library. 

**1. What is the difference between supervised and unsupervised learning?**

Supervised learning incorporates a data set for training the program to provide it with the ability to determine an   accurate interpretation for newly introduced data. In contrast, unsupervised learning relies on the program finding patterns and relationships between a given data set; unsupervised learning makes correlations between data without the use of training examples.

**2. Describe why the following statement is FALSE: Scikit-Learn has the power to visualize data without a Graphviz, Pandas, or other data analysis libraries.**

Scikit-Learn is a machine learning library uses for data modeling, but it is not helpful in visualizing data. This is why Scikit-Learn is used with other libraries such as Graphviz, Pandas, etc. to assist in the analysis,visualisation, and manipulation of data.

**1.What are “Tensors” and what are they used for in Machine Learning?**

Tensors are multidimensional data arrays that communicate between the edges of mathematical operations wihin a data flow graph. Tensors can be genrealized to illustrate plane vectors, covectors, and linear operators. In machine learning they are used to train deep learning models and the operations within neural networks. 

**2. What did you notice about the computations that you ran in the TensorFlow
programs (i.e. interactive models) in the tutorial?**

The computations illustrated how the tensor arrays are computed together, how constants do not change the value of the tensors, and that "sess.close()" will close the session automatically.
Additionally, after loading in the data set, you will get a better insight on how the model performs.

I feel that cyber security is a general problem within our technological filled world, more so, having the ability to use artificial intelligence to predict when an attack may happen could be substantial. I found the data set below that contains data regarding cyber security malware. The deep learning algorithm I think would work best for a solution is a generative adversarial neural networks. As an unsupervised algorithm that can work to distinguish genuine samples from fake samples and generate patterns, I think it would be able to predict malicious attacks through the classification of different malware.
